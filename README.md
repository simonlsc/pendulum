Visualization of pendulum dynamics through the python implementation with the use of Manim 

The core mathematics and trajectory trail algorithm are based on source code of
https://github.com/fajrulfx/visualization101/blob/master/double_pendulum.py

Output movie is almost the same but the underlying code is modified to a more object oriented approach
so that a SimplePendulum class is extracted as the basic component of the DoublePendulum

As a result, I can resue the SimplePendulum class for other animations
